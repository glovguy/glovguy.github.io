There’s a lot of filler content on the internet. Social media still feels very weirdly performative and toxic. Overall, the internet doesn’t feel as free and experimental as it once did.</p><p>So what’s causing it and how can we reverse this trend of degradation of the internet?</p><p>There are many causes. One of the causes of this is an inherent tension in the business model of many internet media companies. We could address this contradiction at the heart of internet media by “unbundling” the internet media business model.</p><h3>Tensions Between Platform and Curation</h3><p>There’s something deeply unsustainable about internet media. The current business model of internet media — from social networks to search engines — suffers from a fundamental tension between two competing business functions: the platform business and the curation business. This tension creates unsustainable feedback loops because of misaligned incentives. The quality of this internet media suffers from a slow-building deterioration in content/interaction quality.</p><p>For plenty of examples, listen to this episode of the Ezra Klein podcast: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o9TQD5W1es">“Will A.I. Break the Internet? Or Save It?”</a>.</p><p>This tension between the platform and curation businesses can be seen in several ways.</p><h4>Quality vs. Quantity</h4><p>The platform business is incentivized to maximize user growth and engagement. In contrast, the curation business wants to retain quality in content and interactions. The content curation business would rather exclude users or content for the sake of maintaining content and interaction standards.</p><h4>Revenue and Content Creation Sustainability</h4><p>When the platform business captures most of the revenue involved in internet media without adequately compensating the creators of that content (whether they be individual creators, community moderators, or indexed websites), it undermines the sustainability models of those quality content creators.</p><p>This can create a destructive cycle where quality content becomes increasingly unsustainable to produce.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Qg6ay_GMWSjKT_hDpTLUUA.jpeg" /></figure><h4>Algorithmic Control</h4><p>Content creators today have little influence over how their work is distributed on internet media sites. This is true of individual creators as well as established news networks. Unless users go to a site controlled by the content creator, or the content creator is able to directly message the user, the decision about how and when that content is shown is decided by content curation algorithms on internet media sites.</p><p>This leads to two problems:</p><ol><li><strong>Valuable but less engaging content gets buried.</strong> There is no longer a way to have content consumers “eat their vegetables”. Think of deeply researched journalism on important topics being buried underneath attention-grabbing material with less substance.</li><li><strong>Content curation algorithms can be exploited faster than platforms can respond.</strong> As internet media platforms scale, these problems can compound. Small-scale exploits can become worse, but are individually too minor for the business to be worth addressing. This means that as platforms grow in size, they will often become less reactive to (or will ignore) exploits. Plus, they are less likely to proactively nurture the quality content / interactions.</li></ol><p>These two problems together are the reasons misinformation can spread so quickly and easily on social media. Thoughtful and well-researched content gets de-prioritized if it can’t compete with sensationalist misinformation. In addition, sensationalized misinformation is an exploit of social media that is challenging to counteract. Truth and nuance are positive qualities, but they have a competitive disadvantage in social media.</p><p>Both of these illustrate why those content curation algorithms should be controlled by the businesses who are incentivized to produce quality content. Content creators and community managers — not the internet media platforms — are best prepared for tuning and using the algorithms that determine what users see. They understand their audiences, care about content quality / integrity, and have direct incentives to maintain high standards. The platform’s role should be to provide reliable infrastructure, not to make editorial decisions.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*idkvpdFs2vSKIhTBSXy4uA.jpeg" /></figure><h4>User Choice</h4><p>Currently, if an internet media site hosts content you want to see, you are only able to use the moderation system that they have set up. This doesn’t give users any choice in “shopping around” to choose the best algorithm for their needs. The curation decisions made by algorithms are not neutral. They are making decisions about what is worth viewing or not viewing, and also what is worth being made or not being made. Why shouldn’t they be subject to market forces?</p><p>A common reaction to this is to point out that many platforms respond to the behavior of their users in order to show them what they “want”. This is a misdirection: just because users react in a certain way does not mean that content is worth prioritizing. It doesn’t even mean that users actually <em>want</em> that content to be prioritized.</p><p>Views aren’t value. Engagement isn’t endorsement.</p><p>Internet media companies treating these two concepts as the same is only a way to “launder” their curation choices by making it appear to have been passively chosen by the end user.</p><p>Users should have the freedom and choice to pick what content curation systems they use, independently of the content that is hosted on it.</p><h3>The Solution: Unbundling</h3><p>The solution lies in separating internet media companies into two distinct businesses: content platforms and content curators. While platforms would handle the technical infrastructure of hosting and serving content, independent curation services would make editorial decisions about content presentation.</p><p>The <a href="https://codetiburon.com/business-model-patterns-online-enterprise/">“unbundling” business model pattern</a> involves separating a business along three lines: infrastructure management, customer relationships, and product innovation. For internet media, the infrastructure business would be the content platform, and customer relationship business would be the content curation.</p><ul><li><strong>Infrastructure Management (Platform / Hosting):</strong> Manages the platform that stores / serves content, integrations with partner applications, as well as the advertisement bidding/serving platform. Manages key partners, such as with the advertisement agencies that pay to serve ads.</li><li><strong>Customer Relationship (Curation):</strong> Manages channels such as the web/mobile interfaces that users use to access content, as well as the systems that decide what users see when they open a feed (i.e. curation algorithms). Manages the recommendation systems that power these feeds (using the usage data provided by the platform business). Manages customer relationships by creating and maintaining communities.</li><li><strong>Product Innovation:</strong> Manages tech innovations that allow novel interactions with internet media. E.g. face filters, content editing tools.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KCTuvR3phDDSyM5FiucXBA.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>The key move here is splitting the platform and curation businesses.</strong> (The product innovation business is already naturally separated in internet media, since it is difficult to maintain a moat around software innovations. For example, when a new social media company rises in popularity based on some technical innovation, others will follow suit to quickly copy that feature.)</p><p>The division between platform and curation follows a natural split between “descriptive” and “normative”. The platform business would answer factual questions such as “what did XYZ user post in the last 24 hours?” The curation business would be in charge of editorial judgments about content value and presentation. They would answer normative questions such as “what is the most important news for today?”</p><p>Under this split, internet media platforms would focus on reliable content hosting, while separate curation companies would compete on their ability to filter and present that content meaningfully.</p><p>This unbundling change offers three key benefits:</p><h4>Aligned incentives</h4><ul><li>Platform businesses can optimize for reliability and scale.</li><li>Curation businesses can compete with each other on quality and community standards.</li></ul><h4>Clearer Accountability</h4><ul><li>Unbundling would squarely place curation responsibility with those who control the curation algorithms. This would be in contrast to how internet media companies currently subtly deflect responsibility for the outcomes of algorithmic curation to users.</li><li>Platform businesses shed liability for how content is presented and the secondary effects of these editorial decisions.</li></ul><h4><strong>User Choice</strong></h4><ul><li>Users will be able to choose their preferred curation service, incentivizing the curation businesses to differentiate with better quality curation.</li><li>There will be greater transparency in content filtering methods and decision-makers involved.</li><li>Users will be able to switch between curation services without leaving a platform.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pRsNOYhkzS_a3VRJe0je2w.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The concept of unbundling isn’t new. Banking and telecommunications companies provide helpful precedents, where core infrastructure was successfully separated from consumer-facing services. Banks, for instance, separated their retail operations from investment banking. Telecom companies distinguished network infrastructure from customer-facing services.</p><p>There have been <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/unbundling-social-media-a-taxonomy-of-problem-areas/">some suggestions</a> to <a href="https://cnnumerique.fr/en/social-media-exploring-opportunity-unbundling-conversation-maria-luisa-stasi">similarly unbundle internet media companies</a>.</p><p>One way to try and achieve this change would be to <a href="https://hbr.org/1999/03/unbundling-the-corporation">strategically reduce the organizational friction between internet companies while increasing the organizational friction within them</a>. This would mean making it easier for independent curation companies to interact with core platform infrastructure as well as creating distance between the platform and curation functions within existing companies. This is an example of how government regulation could be used to increase user choice</p><p>An example of what an unbundled social media ecosystem looks like: it would allow users to not only see how content curation algorithms work, but also be able to build their own curation systems using the same underlying data that the platform uses. If someone is sufficiently motivated to create and maintain a social media feed, they should be able to build one the same way they can build their own website.</p><p>There are many problems with the current state of the internet. This change would by no means be a panacea, but we won’t get the internet we deserve until we align incentives so that the internet can grow in a healthy way.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d5bb5b506ce6" width="1" height="1" alt="">
