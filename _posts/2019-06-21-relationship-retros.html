Romance can be agile, too.</p><p>I’m an agile nerd and my girlfriend is a newly minted psychiatrist. At my suggestion, she and I have been doing “relationship retros,” based loosely on agile retros. We use that time to talk about what went well for us as a couple and what we want to improve in our relationship. It seems natural to use these practices to improve our relationship. After all, relationships require teamwork and communication.</p><p>We would typically use the “happy / sad / confused” retro format. It’s one of my favorites since it’s so straightforward. Deliberately having a positive section was helpful for us so that our relationship retro didn’t feel overly negative or like a conflict.</p><p>The other day I stumbled upon an intriguing book in a used book store: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marriage-Meetings-Lasting-Love-Relationship/dp/1608682234/"><em>Marriage Meetings for Lasting Love</em></a>. It described practices that I recognized in our retros, but their tactics were more specifically tailored to couples rather than tech companies.</p><h3>Why Bother with a Relationship Retro?</h3><p>You might ask: <em>hey nerd, isn’t this just a bunch of weirdo rationality that fails to take into account that relationships are about emotion and not about logic and facts?</em></p><p>I’m glad you might have asked. The answer is that the dichotomy between emotions and facts is a false one. All this structure and planning isn’t meant to get rid of the emotion, but to give it a place to be expressed.</p><p>One important feature a relationship retro provides is a chance to identify and tackle problems together as a couple. A well-running relationship retro should: <br>1) provide a space where both partners feel comfortable bringing up issues that need to be addressed, and<br>2) be an opportunity for the couple to try to work on the problem together.</p><p>Relationship retros provide a feedback loop. It gives those in the relationship an opportunity to voice their emotions and for there to be any necessary course corrections.</p><p>Collaboration in a relationship is different from a lot of collaboration in a business in one key way: there is no authority to mediate. At work you have a boss, and that person can provide guidance. If your team is not solving the right problem, or doing it the wrong way, your boss can provide a course correction.</p><p>There is no reporting structure in a romantic relationship and unbalanced power dynamics can often make or break collaboration.</p><p>In a <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/05/21/esther-perel/">fantastic conversation about relationships between Tim Ferriss and psychotherapist Esther Perel</a>, Tim describes a conversation he had with someone who set up a “report card” feedback system for his open marriage.</p><blockquote><strong>Tim Ferriss:</strong> [H]is wife gives him a report card every quarter. So every three months he gets a report card. I think it was a 1 to 10 scale in four categories. Lover, husband, provider, father. He’s allowed to have a low score in any one of those as long as his average is high enough. So they agreed on what his average had to be. […]</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Esther Perel:</strong> When you describe this example, and you like it because of its measurements, I would say I like it because of its creativity because there’s thoughtfulness, because there’s a shared complicity, because it seems to have worked, because there’s imaginativeness and resourcefulness in it and because I think that couples often lack a lot of that. […]</blockquote><blockquote>In this instance that you described, what’s beautiful is you feel like whatever he does, she gets to evaluate him. And so the evaluation is power, it’s authority. In the good sense of the word I use the word power. So they are calibrating power. You get to do things, but I don’t want to have to suffer because of it. I want to know that I still get the primary goods. I want to know that I come first.</blockquote><p>What Esther Perel describes as “calibrating power”, that’s the sort of thing that relationship retros are meant to facilitate.</p><h3>Relationship Retro Format</h3><p>My girlfriend and I tried out the format recommended in the book, and I definitely think it is a better fit for a relationship than most traditional retrospective formats. I’ll give a breakdown of the structure that they recommend.</p><p>The meeting format provided by the book was tailored for those in traditional marriages. Many of the tips are most relevant to long-term relationships where the partners live with each other, and some aspects of it might not apply as neatly to other types of relationships. Results may vary. Feel free to tweak and adjust the format to fit your needs.</p><p>The book recommends scheduling a meeting once a week, and keeping the entire meeting under 45 minutes. Having meetings that are short and regular is good for keeping the lines of communication open.</p><p>If you have kids, the book recommends including them in meetings, so long as the parents get a chance to meet on their own as well. The kids are part of the family and can benefit from the discussion.</p><h4>General Discussion Tips</h4><p>The book also highly recommends holding the meetings in a private place and putting other tasks on hold. For example, don’t do laundry in the middle of a meeting, or try to have a relationship retro while eating dinner at a restaurant. It may be tempting to multi-task such a straightforward thing, but having those interruptions breaks the flow of conversation. Choosing to give that undivided attention may be hard, but it’s essential for the meeting to be successful.</p><p>Listen actively. If you want to listen more deliberately, repeat back what you hear from your partner after they speak.</p><p>The book doesn’t recommend anything that looks quite like the <a href="http://www.retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive">retrospective prime directive</a>, but adopting a similar mantra for the first few meetings could likely be beneficial. At the very least take to heart the spirit of the prime directive.</p><p>Assuming good intentions on the part of your partner goes a long way. Don’t blame each other. Attack the problems, not each other. Try to use language that is less likely to make the other person feel attacked, like using “I” statements. For example, rather than saying “it’s annoying when you don’t do the dishes,” say “I feel annoyed when you don’t do the dishes.”</p><p>Speak up! Say what is on your mind, even if you’re afraid of how your partner will react. If this is the person you will be with for a while, you need to trust that they can handle hearing what you have to say.</p><p>The book also recommends using a back and forth turn-taking format for most discussions. Let the quieter partner speak first, and the other partner listens or asks clarifying questions. Only after the first partner says they are done does the other partner take their turn. By taking turns, it can give space for the quieter partner to voice their opinion. This is part of the “calibrating power” that these meetings are meant to provide. This particular tactic may not be necessary for everyone, but I think it is a useful suggestion for couples who are not used to communicating, or when one partner tends to dominate conversations.</p><h4>Structure of a Meeting</h4><p>There are four parts to the meeting formula recommended by the book:</p><ol><li><strong>Appreciation</strong></li><li><strong>Chores</strong></li><li><strong>Plan for Good Times</strong></li><li><strong>Problems and Challenges</strong></li></ol><p>Each step tackles a different topic and has different goals. I’ll walk through each of them:</p><h4>1) Appreciation</h4><p>Relationships are supposed to be a positive part of our lives, right? It’s important to take time to appreciate each other and remind yourselves about what is good in your relationship and what has gone well.</p><p>For the first part of the meeting, take turns listing out what you like or admire about your partner as well as what went well in your relationship since the last time you had a retro.</p><p>Making time to list what you appreciate starts the meeting on a positive note. It ensures the two of you don’t get bogged down in negativity, and that the positive isn’t forgotten.</p><h4>2) Chores</h4><p>This is time set aside for talking about household chores and shared responsibilities and keeping them managed. This section is most useful for those who share a living space or are raising children together.</p><p>You and your partner list out chores on your collective to-do list. Together, decide which tasks need to get handled within the next week, and which can wait.</p><p>For all of the tasks that need to be handled in the next week, agree on how they will get done. Assign it to someone, or delegate the task. For example, fixing a broken sink can be delegated to a professional plumber.</p><p>For the tasks that don’t need to be done in the next week or require attention for longer than a week, set a time line for it to get done or put it on hold. In this way, these meetings function like weekly standup.</p><p>It sucks talking about chores, but if there’s shared responsibility in the relationship, this time can be super helpful. Here’s one reason why you should care: couples who share household chores in a more egalitarian way have better sex.</p><blockquote>In fact, several studies report […] that couples who share household tasks have sex more often than those in which one partner slacks off in the chores arena. A husband in one of these studies said his wife enjoys flowers or a candlelit restaurant dinner, “but if he wants to be sure of a romantic evening, he goes for the vacuum cleaner.”<br>- <em>Marriage Meetings for Lasting Love</em> (p.48)</blockquote><p>It’s just something to keep in mind.</p><h4>3) Plan for Good Times</h4><p>Relationships should be fun, and fun doesn’t just spring out of nowhere. This part of the meeting is set aside for the advance planning necessary for good times.</p><p>Together, make suggestions of activities. These activities could include:</p><ul><li>a weekly date,</li><li>self-nurturing activities,</li><li>vacations,</li><li>outings with friends, etc.</li></ul><p>Together, decide what you will do, and then set a date and time. By setting aside this time to plan, it ensures you don’t reach the end of the week without having made time to plan something for that week.</p><p>The author recommends having regular dates to maintain a healthy relationship. This is especially important for families with kids where the couple needs to deliberately set aside time to spend together as a couple, and not just as parents.</p><p>The activities could also be for time to spend alone. When life is busy, it’s easy for one (or both) of the partners to end up not getting enough time for themselves. This is a mistake. Self-nurturing activities are just as important to maintaining a healthy relationship as time together. It’s worthwhile to make sure everyone in the relationship has a change to do what grounds them.</p><p>Here’s a video where Casey Neistat explains how he believes maintaining separate interests is important for a relationship.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FqH9IaOxypwE%3Fstart%3D426%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D426&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqH9IaOxypwE&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FqH9IaOxypwE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/a012c126a4b1473f91edd3af23dc7900/href">https://medium.com/media/a012c126a4b1473f91edd3af23dc7900/href</a></iframe><p>Certain people can fall into what the book calls the “martyr trap”. This is when someone tries to sacrifice their own well being for the sake of others. They might say something like “I am too busy. By not making time for myself, I am making more time for doing things for others.”</p><p>This is a destructive habit and not sustainable. Investing in time for yourself benefits everyone because it replenishes your energy. It may seem selfish, but, in practice, taking care of yourself means that there is more of you to give to others.</p><h4>4) Problems and Challenges</h4><p>This section can be a significant part of the meeting, and there’s a reason it’s saved for last. This is the time to bring up topics that may be difficult to discuss so that they aren’t put off indefinitely. This needn’t be just problems that you have with each other, but includes all problems that you are trying to tackle as a couple.</p><p>For the first few relationship meetings, talk about easy problems. If one person jumps right into really tough subjects in the first meeting, their partner might not be on board with having future meetings. Wait to discuss really touchy subjects after having done a few meetings, so that there is some practice and habit behind having these discussions.</p><p>The book recommends a very particular format for these discussions. One of the partners mentions an area of concern to be discussed. The other responds respectfully, not giving their side of things, but simply asking for clarification and showing understanding.</p><p>Once that first partner feels understood, the other expresses his/her thoughts and feelings on the subject. Partners continue taking turns discussing until they both feel heard and understood.</p><p>If you and your partner have practice discussing tough subjects, this back and forth process might not be necessary. When in doubt, try it out.</p><p>The book defines three types of outcomes of this discussion:</p><ol><li>agreement;</li><li>no agreement, but agree to continue the discussion (not all challenges can be solved in one sitting); or</li><li>acknowledge that change isn’t likely and that both partners can live with it.</li></ol><p>The first two outcomes are fairly obvious, but the third is just as important. Not all problems can be resolved or need to be resolved. Sometimes compromise means accepting that someone or something will not change.</p><p>Only discuss 1–2 problems during this time. Any more than that would take too long.</p><p>This part of the meeting is crucial because without it problems can fester and grow worse the longer they are not addressed. It can be hard to bring up something challenging in a relationship, so having a set time to talk it through means being able to worry less about it at other times.</p><p>Finally, end the meeting on a positive note. Thank each other for participating.</p><h3>Keep Experimenting</h3><p>I’ve stressed that relationship retros help solve problems in a relationship, but it’s definitely more than that. Talking with my girlfriend about writing this essay, she compared relationship retros to preventative medicine. It’s a practice to help maintain a healthy relationship, not just fix problems that crop up.</p><p>Keeping up the habit demonstrates to your partner a willingness to listen to them. It shows you care. Doing this can build trust and help the relationship grow and foster intimacy.</p><p>Agile is not a dogma, but a process. It should be open to changing depending on what works, and so should the format of your relationship retro.</p><p>In the same interview, Esther Perel talks about how there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem.</p><blockquote><strong>Esther Perel:</strong> Every other system gets innovators and gets new ideas put into it all the time, and it’s extraordinary how much relationships enter into a certain mode and then stay in it for decades. […]</blockquote><blockquote>So anything where I see couples coming up with their own imaginative solutions to various situations and then be flexible about it, and review it and change it, to me is great. That’s it. I think that unfortunately, coupledom does not benefit from the same innovation spirit that every other company and entrepreneurial space these days gets to benefit.</blockquote><p>So don’t take my word at it, try it out for yourself and see what works. Use that innovative spirit to better your relationship. Don’t forget to report back what works for you.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=625ee5a27d5f" width="1" height="1" alt="">
